2.1.4

BitTorrent Sync was a proprietary peer-to-peer file synchronization tool available for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Amazon Kindle Fire and FreeBSD.

MacOs may detect app as malware. However no engines on Virustotal were able to find something and thus the only issue here is a Mac OS Gatekeeper containing hashes of app.
As of my own opinion malware exists in builds from 2016. Permissions requested are equal to permissions needed by ReiKey.
