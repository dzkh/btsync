BitTorrent Sync was a proprietary peer-to-peer file synchronization tool available for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Amazon Kindle Fire and FreeBSD.

MacOs may detect app as malware. However no engines on Virustotal (7d38b81cf0ef553dd1f67f719e6e21ba4f745723ccb905c668470e44104caf56) were able to find something and thus the only issue here is a Mac OS Gatekeeper containing hashes of app.
As of my own opinion malware exists in builds from 2016. Permissions requested are equal to permissions needed by ReiKey.
