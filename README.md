- 1.3 - classic version without links support. Preferable to use in close environments. This version will probably out of support by tracker and the only way to find remote peer in this case is known hosts.
- 1.4.x - They established Resilio Inc. using forked sources. Added supports sharing via links and rewritten internals.
- 2.0.x - this is selective sync verion. Every sharing request can be approved,single file can be shared. Request-approval are unstable in any DPI-enabled network plus relies on external services. Can be turned off and should.

**MacOs**
Os may detect app as malware. However no engines on Virustotal (7d38b81cf0ef553dd1f67f719e6e21ba4f745723ccb905c668470e44104caf56) were able to find something and thus the only issue here is a Mac OS Gatekeeper.

As of my own opinion malware exists in builds from 2016. Permissions requested are equal to permissions needed by ReiKey. ReiKey used to detect keyloggers. But maybe they control hotkeys that way?

**Linux**
For 1.3 and 1.4 it wasn't planned to support i386, x86_64 with old glibc. Do not expect that.
